This is a post that gives a brief description of the algorithm of hand gesture recognition that I developed. It serves as a reminder of what has been done and what remains to be done. You can download the codes in [Github](https://github.com/imkaywu/Gesture-Recognition-3), feel free to try out and change the code.Let me introduce our algorithm step by step.

> 1. [Find the contour points and connect them in a consecutive manner](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/23/Find-the-contour-of-the-hand-gestures.html).

> 2. [Find the centroid of hand gesture using **distance transform**.](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/23/Find-the-centroid-of-the-hand-gestures.html)

> 3. [Find the direction of the hand gesture using the relative positions of contour points (using just Step 1).](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/23/Find-the-direction-of-hand-gestures.html)

> 4. [Transform the hand contour (points above the centroid, which contribute more to the hand direction) into a *time-series curve*.](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/23/Transform-to-time-series-curve.html)

> 5. [Find the initial positions of the fingertips and fingerroots (using just Step 1).](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/24/Find-the-fingertips-and-fingerroots.html)

> 6. [Refine the positions of fingertips and fingerroots(using Step 2).](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/24/Find-the-fingertips-and-fingerroots.html)

> 7. [Find the accurate direction of the hand gesture using the directions of fingers(using Step 2).](http://imkaywu.com/2013/11/23/Find-the-direction-of-hand-gestures.html)

> 7. [Recognition scheme 1: Use the positions of the fingertips and fingerroots for recognition.]()

> 8. [Recognition scheme 2: Transform the contour points into the time-series curve again and take samples. For each gesture, we can obtain a feature vector. Use Machine Learning algorithm to train the data for recognition.]()

This is pretty much everything about our hand gesture recognition algorithm, the source code is constantly changing because I am still refining the algorithm.
