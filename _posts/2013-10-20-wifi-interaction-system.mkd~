In this project, we aimed to address the issue of lack of interaction between lecturers and students. With the help of our system, student can answer multiple choice questions with the mobile app, the answers are dynamically changed according to the students' choice. Or students can send questions they don't understand to the PC program in the form of text. The system requires no database or web server whatesoever, highly portable.
