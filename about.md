I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in Electric Engineer in [Beijing University of Posts & Telecom](www.bupt.edu.cn/‎). I'm a keen programmer and willing to try out new stuffs.

I'm not a CS/SE student, I self-learn how to code and find it really satisfactory when I write something cool and amazing. When I'm coding, I can just sit there for hours and concentrate on the problem I want to solve. I also love Linux and all the cool stuffs it offers. I'm willing to spend days of time just sitting in front my computer doing things that other people find meaningless. Like configuring my Vim editor, try out the plugins for my firefox/chrome browsers(I'm a hardcore user of firefox), install new versions of software to check out the new features it offers, install small gadget(like dock, clover) to make my machine cooler. I just find it fun to do so, nothing more.

As for my other interests, I like to watch my favorite movies for thousands of times. These include Godfather Trilog, Bourne Trilog, The Lord of the Rings, Matrix, Die Hard, and etc. And I like the type of music that have beautiful melodies, like songs of Jay Chou, Backstreet Boys (Believe it or not, I just started to listen to their music and fell in love with their songs). Though someone may call this out-of-date, I believe moving melodies would never go out. And everytime I listen to them, they can always bring up the memories from the old time. Like when I started to listen to *晴天(a song by Jay Chou)*, I realized that I had listend to that song when I was a kid and after all these years, I can still recognize the melody even though I haven't heard it for years. It's just incredible.

So this is a little bit information about me, thanks for visiting my tech blog. Enjoy yourself and have a nice day.
